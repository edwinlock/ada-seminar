  Our weekly seminar series covers a broad range of exciting topics, from algorithms and statistical modeling to cutting-edge areas such as machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. Each week, a member of the ADA team presents their research or share insights, sparking discussions, sharing practical tips, and real-world examples from their projects. We welcome all interested individuals - students, postdocs, and faculty members - to learn from colleagues, share ideas, and contribute to a vibrant academic community!
